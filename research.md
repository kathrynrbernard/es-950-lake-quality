## Background Research

#### Effects of Pier Shading on Littoral Zone Habitat and Communities in Lakes Ripley and Rock, Jefferson County, Wisconsin

* Summary: piers and other structures in the water are linked to fewer aquatic plants, fewer macroinvertebrates (snails and scuds), and fewer fish in the surrounding area
* Related variables: PIERS_CNT, BOAT_LIFT_CNT, SWIM_RAFT_CNT, BOATHOUSE_CNT, MARINAS_CNT, STRUCTURE_OTHER_CNT

#### Comparisons of Undeveloped and Developed Shorelands, Northern Wisconsin, and Recommendations for Restoration

* Summary: undeveloped areas had more canopy/subcanopy/understory vegetation and more floating vegetation than developed areas, but no differences in percent cover for either ground or floating plants. Undeveloped areas also had more coarse woody debris.
* Related variables: CANOPY_PCT, SHRUB_HERB_PCT, EMERGENT_VEG_PRES, FLOATING_VEG_PRES

* Summary: in this study, more undeveloped shoreline plots had emergent or floating-leaf vegetation than developed shoreline plots; smaller docks were more likely to have surrounding vegetation than larger docks
  * Significant correlations between occurrence of emergent and floating-leaf plants and size of fish
* Related variables: EMERGENT_VEG_PRES, FLOATING_VEG_PRES, FLOAT_EMERG_PRES, PIERS_CNT, BOAT_LIFT_CNT, SWIM_RAFT_CNT, BOATHOUSE_CNT, MARINAS_CNT, STRUCTURE_OTHER_CNT, BUILDINGS_CNT
